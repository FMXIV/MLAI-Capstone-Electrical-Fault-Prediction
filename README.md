# Predicting Failures in Power Transmission Lines

## Overview

In the energy sector, ensuring the consistent and reliable operation of power transmission lines is vital for maintaining operational efficiency and managing costs effectively. Our predictive maintenance solution leverages sophisticated machine learning algorithms to anticipate potential failures in power transmission lines well in advance of their occurrence. By adopting this proactive strategy, we can optimize maintenance schedules, minimize unplanned downtime, and significantly enhance the overall reliability of the power transmission system. This approach not only helps in maintaining uninterrupted power supply but also contributes to substantial cost savings and improved resource allocation.

## Business Understanding

### Objective

Our objective is to develop a highly accurate predictive model that forecasts failures in power transmission lines. By predicting failures before they occur, we aim to:
- Optimize maintenance schedules to prevent unexpected breakdowns.
- Reduce downtime, enhancing the reliability of power delivery.
- Lower maintenance costs by addressing issues before they escalate.

### Context

Predictive maintenance is essential in utility networks due to the high costs associated with equipment failures. These costs include repair expenses and lost productivity. Accurate failure prediction enables timely interventions, reducing unplanned outages and improving operational efficiency.

### Goals

- **High Accuracy**: Develop a model with high precision and recall to accurately forecast failures.
- **Preemptive Maintenance**: Enable timely maintenance actions to prevent equipment failures.
- **Minimized Downtime**: Reduce operational disruptions and extend the lifespan of power transmission lines.

### Research Question

Can machine learning algorithms accurately predict failures in power transmission lines, thereby optimizing maintenance schedules and minimizing downtime?

## Data Understanding

### Data Sources

- **Dataset**: [Electrical Fault Detection and Classification](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/esathyaprakash/electrical-fault-detection-and-classification)

### Data Collection

We utilized two datasets for this analysis:
1. **`detect_dataset.csv`**: Contains measurements of current and voltage, along with a fault indicator.
2. **`classData.csv`**: Includes class labels with corresponding current and voltage measurements.

### Initial Data Exploration

The data was explored to understand its structure, distribution, and quality. We performed statistical analysis and visualizations to identify patterns and potential issues such as missing values.

## Data Preparation

### Data Cleaning

- **Removed Columns**: Dropped columns with all missing values to ensure data quality.

### Data Transformation

- **Normalization**: Applied normalization to current and voltage measurements using StandardScaler to improve model performance.

### Data Splitting

- **Training and Testing Sets**: Split the data into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance effectively.

## Modeling

### Model Selection

We compared the performance of four advanced classifiers to identify the best approach for predicting faults:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**
- **Neural Networks (MLP)**

### Model Training

Each model was trained on the training data, and its performance was evaluated based on F1-score and ROC-AUC.

## Evaluation

### Model Evaluation

We assessed each model using key performance metrics:

   - **ROC-AUC**: 0.999984
   - **Processing Time**: 9.89 seconds
   - **Insight**: Outstanding performance across all metrics, making it a robust model for fault prediction.

3. **Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)**
   - **F1 Score**: 0.9978
   - **ROC-AUC**: 0.999988
   - **Processing Time**: 33.51 seconds
   - **Insight**: Highest accuracy and ROC-AUC score. Although it has a longer processing time, it is highly effective.

4. **Neural Network (MLP)**
   - **F1 Score**: 0.9966
   - **ROC-AUC**: 0.999964
   - **Processing Time**: 2.66 seconds
   - **Insight**: Strong performance with a good balance between accuracy and processing time.

### Key Takeaways

- **Best Model**: The Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) achieved the highest F1 score and ROC-AUC, indicating exceptional predictive accuracy. However, its longer processing time might affect real-time applications.
- **Alternative Models**: Random Forest and MLP models offer excellent performance with shorter processing times. Random Forest provides slightly higher accuracy, while MLP offers a good balance of performance and efficiency.

### Recommendations

- **For Real-Time Applications**: Consider using MLP or Random Forest models to achieve high performance with shorter processing times.
- **For Maximum Accuracy**: If the highest possible accuracy is crucial and processing time is less of a concern, Gradient Boosting is the preferred choice.

## Key Benefits

- **Predictive Accuracy**: Our models deliver high accuracy, precision, and recall, ensuring reliable failure prediction.
- **Operational Efficiency**: By reducing unplanned downtime, our solution enhances the reliability of power transmission systems.
- **Cost Savings**: Proactive maintenance enabled by our model helps lower repair costs and minimize productivity losses.

## Conclusion


Our fault prediction solution provides a highly effective tool designed to optimize maintenance schedules and enhance the reliability of power transmission lines. By employing advanced machine learning techniques and conducting comprehensive evaluations, our models deliver a dependable and efficient method for managing equipment failures.
